            "\n",
            "Former Post Office boss Paula Vennells has been accused of living in \"la-la land\" by a lawyer representing sub-postmasters. Speaking at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Edward Henry grilled Ms Vennells on how much she knew about remote access to sub-postmasters' computers. He also pressed Ms Vennells on how fallout from the scandal could have upset the Royal Mail stock market flotation in 2013. She said it would have done, but that she was not involved in the strategy around privatisation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Friday was the third day that Ms Vennells gave evidence at the long-running inquiry into the Horizon scandal. The room was packed with people, including many former sub-postmasters. Their mood became more defiant as the day progressed, until at the end many booed Ms Vennells. The question of remote access has been one of the themes of the inquiry. The Post Office said in hundreds of wrongful prosecutions of sub-postmasters that they must have been to blame for money missing from accounts, which were calculated using the Horizon IT system. Prosecutions between 1999 and 2015 meant some people went to prison, while many others were left financially ruined and lost their jobs, businesses and homes. Some died while waiting for justice. In certain key cases, such as the landmark Bates vs Post Office in 2019, the organisation insisted that the Horizon software could not be accessed remotely by any other party. But Mr Henry said that external lawyers acting for the Post Office knew about remote access earlier than that, during Ms Vennells time as chief executive between 2012 and 2019. She denied knowledge, and said she did not think the board or the executive knew either. Mr Henry said: \"It is extraordinary, isn't it, because Cartwright King, your external lawyers, know all about it, and yet you're saying that you didn't, the board didn't - I mean, this is la-la land isn't it?\" She said: \"I don't recall that at all from the time. If our external lawyers were aware of that, and that was shared within the Post Office at the time, it is complately unacceptable.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Ms Vennells also conceded that Horizon fallout would have upset the Royal Mail stock market flotation. Mr Henry said: \"If it were to be established that the Royal Mail group had wrongly prosecuted dozens, hundreds of sub-postmasters who might sue them, it would have threatened to disrupt the flotation in October 2013, wouldn't it?\" \"I'm sure that would have been the case,\" Ms Vennells said. It would also have posed a reputational and financial risk to the Royal Mail group because until 2012 they were the prosecuting authority, he said - \"they were responsible for the legacy of prosecutions.\" \"Yes, that's correct,\" she responded. In July 2013, the government announced the Royal Mail privatisation, and forensic accountants Second Sight presented their interim report, \"which was a bit of a bombshell\" Mr Henry said, because it indicated Horizon bugs. \"It must have been staring you in the face that if you had a blow up concerning the Second Sight report, the prospect of criminal convictions would have been challenged, this would have been hugely embarrassing politically, and potentially damaging to the flotation?\" Mr Henry said. Ms Vennells responded, saying: \"I don't believe I was involved in any of those conversations. The two organisations were now working separately, I had no conversations about any strategy around the Royal Mail privatisation.\" Mr Henry pressed Ms Vennells, saying she \"wanted to keep a lid on this because you wanted to please stakeholders - the Post Office board, government, Whitehall.\" He said Ms Vennells was \"anxious to please\" the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) at the time. The Post Office is 100% owned by the UK government. \"I had no role at all in relation to the privatisation, I had no conversations with BIS with regards to the privatisation,\" she said. \"My concerns at this stage were only about the Post Office, and as the inquiry has seen there were many conversations at this time about how we might find a way through this. I don't believe I made any connection between this and the Royal Mail privatisation at all,\" she said.\n",

Carys trained hard for the tough three-day selection process at Whittington Barracks, near Lichfield, in Staffordshire, and her work paid off.

Over the past five years, the Army has rejected 125,861 applicants, according to the UK Defence Journal - more than 76,000 on medical grounds.

Some women with the gene variant have preventative mastectomy (breast removal). If a candidate appears at risk of a specific genetic disorder, the occupational physician responsible for recruit selection will assess the risk and its likely impact on the candidate’s health and safety in a military workplace - normally, without the need for genetic testing, the Army says. Last week, the Army told Carys it would review its decision. A spokesperson said, \"We can confirm that we’re reviewing the circumstances of this case and have contacted the individual to explain what’s happened and apologise. \"The issue is now being managed by the Army’s head of recruiting, personally.” On Friday, after we published our story, Carys has been offered a place in the Army and can start basic training in October. In a statement the Army admitted there had been a mistake and said there was no policy of discrimination. \"Following a review of her case, it was concluded that she was wrongly told that she had been rejected as medically unfit. \"She has now been passed medically fit to join the Army and her application is being processed. \"This was a process mistake and not a policy of discrimination \"Whilst a candidate may be referred to occupational physicians for their case to be reviewed, a candidate who presents with the BRCA1 gene would not routinely be rejected from joining the Army.\" Speaking to Anita Rani on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, Carys said she was concerned the mistake the Army medical assessors made in her case would not have been noticed had it not been for the publicity around her case, but she is excited to start her training.\n",

The 30-year-old had denied killing or injuring her son, who had suffered extensive and excruciating burns to his bottom half, but admitted caning him in accordance with her religious beliefs.

Robinson, who is originally from Tamworth, Staffordshire, told jurors she was following the teachings of her religion, the Black Hebrew Israelites, which preached punishing children. Prosecutor Richard Wright KC said her actions had been \"sadistic\" with \"extreme cruelty\" and Dwelaniyah was subjected to \"ritual and persistent beatings\". He said the boy was repeatedly struck with a cane even while he was seriously injured with the burns.\n",

Robinson, who sacked her legal team towards the end of her trial, spoke for herself at the sentencing after a second barrister withdrew from representing her shortly before the hearing. She called the charges against her \"false\" and claimed she was \"innocent\". Robinson said: \"I did not kill my child in anyway, however the prosecution chooses to say it, whichever way anyone wants to imagine it, the fact is I did not kill my child. \"I stand by that and will forever stand by that, I pray for the day justice will be served.\"\n",

The judge said Robinson \"plunged\" her son into a bath she knew was too hot because she was \"angry\" after he soiled himself, causing \"appalling\" and \"dreadful\" burns. Then, despite him having burns covering 20% of his body, she did not seek medical treatment for him because she was \"worried\" about what would happen to her, and her attempt to treat him with ointments and bandages bought online was \"wholly inadequate\". The judge said she was \"callous\" and later caned Dwelaniyah as she \"mistakenly\" interpreted her religious teachings to believe it was \"appropriate\" to punish her son by hitting him with a bamboo cane. \"What must have gone through the mind of this little boy being beaten with a cane by his mother despite these terrible burns does not bear thinking about,\" the Mr Justice Garnham said. As well as causing physical pain to her son, Robinson's \"mistreatment\" also involved leaving him home alone unsupervised \"for lengthy periods\" while she went shopping or to medical appointments, the judge said. He said against the \"background of such abuse\" she murdered her son by \"shaking him forcefully and repeatedly\", although the judge added he could not be sure she meant to kill him as oppose to just cause really serious harm.\n",

He added: \"There is no change without Scotland, there is no Labour without Scotland, Scotland is central to the mission of the next Labour government\". Both Sir Keir and the Conservative leader Rishi Sunak are hoping that this election marks the end of an era in which the Scottish National Party has dominated Scottish politics. Campaigning in the port of Nigg on the Cromarty Firth in the Highlands on Thursday, the prime minister criticised the SNP for imposing higher taxes on workers earning more than £28,500 in Scotland than elsewhere in the UK.

The SNP has been the dominant force in Scottish politics since Alex Salmond's victory in the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary election and, since 2015, Scotland's largest party at Westminster when, led by Nicola Sturgeon, it won an incredible 56 of the nation's 59 seats. At the most recent general election, in 2019, the SNP took 48 seats, the Conservatives six, the Lib Dems four, and Labour — for decades the powerhouse of Scottish politics — just one. Since then though Scottish nationalists have endured tough times. Nicola Sturgeon resigned last year after progress towards a second independence referendum stalled. Then, Humza Yousaf came and went as her successor, quitting just weeks ago after ditching a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens amid disputes about economic and social policy. John Swinney is now in charge of the SNP for the second time in his long career.\n",

They range from record NHS waiting lists, to a stubborn gap in attainment between the richest and poorest school pupils, to the highest level of drugs deaths in Europe. Then there is the police investigation into the SNP's finances which has led to its former chief executive, Peter Murrell, who is married to Ms Sturgeon, facing charges in connection with embezzlement of funds. Mr Swinney is also facing difficult questions about his position on a former minister who tried to claim an £11,000 data roaming bill on expenses. Overall, the SNP is arguably in its weakest position since Scotland voted against independence by 55 per cent to 45 per cent in a 2014 referendum.\n",

Sir John says if this were to be replicated on polling day in a general election it could translate into 30 Scottish seats for Labour and 16 for the SNP. So what issues are people in Scotland considering as they make up their minds? Aside from the economy, Scottish voters tell pollsters they care most about the health service, housing and education, all three of which are the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, not the UK Parliament in London. That does not mean they are irrelevant in this election though. The Scottish government decides how to spend its budget but the overall amount it has available to spend is largely determined by Westminster.\n",

With the SNP, says Sir Keir, voters can send a message to Westminster but with Labour \"Scotland can send a government.\" Mr Swinney retorts that there is now little difference between the two main UK parties. \"Keir Starmer now supports Brexit, whatever the cost to Scotland,\" he said, noting that the UK had left the European Union despite the opposition of a majority of voters in Scotland.\n",

At the same time Mr Swinney keeps trying to turn the attention back to independence, presenting it as an escape route from what the SNP call broken Brexit Britain — a nation of entrenched low growth, low productivity and high inequality. Sir John Curtice says the reason for Mr Swinney adopting this tactic is clear: \"While support for the SNP has fallen sharply over the last year, support for independence has not. The SNP, he says, has lost \"a significant proportion\" of independence supporters to Labour, the Scottish Greens and Mr Salmond's Alba Party. Persuading those voters to return to the SNP represents \"the SNP's best hope of restoring its fortunes between now and 4 July,\" adds Sir John. Although there is no clear mechanism for Scotland to actually achieve independence at present, because both the Conservatives and Labour are intent on blocking a second referendum, some unionists nonetheless argue that the issue must be addressed.\n",

There has been a widespread redrawing of the map for this poll, with the first boundary changes in Scotland since 2005. The overall UK boundary changes modestly favour the Conservatives whose seat total using estimated 2019 results based on the new boundaries would increase by seven to 372. In this \"notional\" scenario, which will form the baseline for TV, radio and online calculations of who is up and down on election night, Scotland has a net loss of two seats, down from 59 to 57.\n",

His fellow MPs gave him a standing ovation when he returned to Parliament. Mr Mackinlay told the BBC the ordeal made him \"realise the important things are family, friends, children.\" His wife Kati, who works as a pharmacist, played a crucial role in recognising his critical condition and securing his medical care.

I had hoped to phase my return to the House of Commons over the coming months as my abilities improved. \"I face numerous future operations as a result of the serious sepsis that I suffered which very nearly took my life. I have only just started the prosthetic journey and I have weekly physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions. \"To be elected to the House of Commons is a rare privilege of life\". Fellow Tory MP Steve Baker paid tribute to Mr Mackinlay as \"an absolute hero\". Visibly upset on BBC Two's Politics Live, Mr Baker said Mr Mackinlay had \"been through absolute hell\". \"I don’t mind openly admitting I’m very moved that he made his way back into parliament and I was glad to be there to hear what he said,\" Mr Baker added.\n",

            "“Labour MPs are happy. We’re not. That tells a story,” one minister fumed in my general direction as he reeled off a list of legislation he had been involved in, now headed for the shredder. That’s just one illustration of the explosive mood in Westminster on Wednesday evening as Conservative MPs reacted to Rishi Sunak’s sudden announcement of a July election with reactions ranging from enthusiasm to outrage. All of Mr Sunak’s MPs, though, were blindsided - including cabinet ministers who had no inkling of what was coming either, even being sent a fake agenda for their Wednesday afternoon meeting. Now that it’s clear that the election really is on, many Conservatives are asking each other a simple question: why? Why did Mr Sunak abruptly, as one senior Conservative put it, “confound the assumption of the entire establishment, not to mention Tory MPs, that it would be autumn - and drop this on them from a height”? It’s worth stating the obvious that this will have all felt a lot less abrupt for Mr Sunak’s tight inner circle. Among the prime minister’s confidants, a lively debate has been raging for months about when the general election should take place. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister and Mr Sunak’s closest friend in the Commons, Liam Booth-Smith, his chief of staff, and James Forsyth, his old friend and political secretary, were at the heart of the deliberations. One of those arguing against an early election, according to multiple sources, was Isaac Levido - the man now charged with running the summer campaign.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mr Levido is an Australian elections guru who also ran Boris Johnson’s successful 2019 general election campaign, having learnt his trade under the wing of Sir Lynton Crosby, mastermind of Lord Cameron’s election victories. This is strongly denied by the Conservatives and, this morning, by Mr Sunak himself, who told LBC it was “not true” that Mr Levido argued against the July date. The balance of the argument is understood to have been drifting towards a summer election for some time - indeed one source claimed it had been the agreed timeframe for “several months.”. James Nation, a former Treasury civil servant who is Mr Sunak’s deputy director of policy, has been working on the manifesto for several months, canvassing ideas from Conservative think tanks. And in hindsight it is possible to see last week’s set-piece events - Mr Sunak’s speech about the dangerous world on the Monday; Jeremy Hunt’s attack on Labour’s economic policies on the Friday - as dress rehearsals. You could look back a little further to late April and Mr Sunak’s trip to Germany where he announced ambitions to increase defence spending as another attempt to entrench general election dividing lines. Mr Sunak is thought to have become particularly exercised about the possibility that if he waited until deep into 2024 to go to the polls, the public would perceive him to be a “squatter” in No 10.\n",

            "Plans to create a new football regulator will not become law before the election, but Labour and the Conservatives say they are committed to bringing in the new rules. The government announced plans for the regulator last year, but it’s understood there will not be time for the required legislation to be passed before parliament is dissolved ahead of the election. Labour’s shadow secretary for culture and sport Thangam Debbonaire told the BBC earlier this week that current plans need to go further to protect the financial sustainability of clubs. Following the news that the laws will not pass before the election a Conservative source said the party is “committed to delivering a sustainable future for local football clubs, with fans at their heart.“ Ms Debbonaire said new laws should benefit “left-behind” areas of the country where the sport is “bound up with a sense of identity and a sense of place”. Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, who first recommended the regulator, said there is now a “ready made Bill for the next government” and she is “100% convinced” that the regulator will be created. A new Radio 4 documentary, ‘Stoppage Time for Scunthorpe’, tells the story of how Scunthorpe United almost went out of business twice in the last 18 months.\n",

            "After a period of ambitious spending that never quite panned out, the funds dried up and results on the pitch took a dramatic downwards turn. Then-owner Peter Swann transferred ownership of the club’s stadium Glanford Park into his own company. In January 2023, Scunthorpe United was served with a winding up order from HMRC, nine months after being relegated to non-league football for the first time in 72 years. With fans fearing the worst could be just days away, they were given hope. “Completely from left field, we heard a name,” said Matt Ellis, host of the fan podcast Iron Bru. “And Hilton just came out of nowhere and swept to power if you like.” After initial jubilation, things turned sour once more. Another relegation followed and an investigation by The Athletic website revealed that David Hilton had previously been sentenced to two years in prison for fraud. He put the club up for sale and it was saved from extinction again when local businesswoman Michelle Harness gathered a consortium of nearby business owners. Working with local Conservative politicians, Ms Harness used £2.5m of central government money from the Department for Levelling Up to buy back Glanford Park and put it into a community asset scheme, meaning the club and the stadium can never be separated again.\n",

            "It’s understood the Labour Party is looking at how the issue of football regulation could be used in its attempt to win back traditional Labour seats like Scunthorpe, that switched to the Conservatives in 2019. Ms Debbonaire said “it’s working people who go to football matches” and that “for many of the towns where there’ve been clubs at the brink, they've also been towns that successive Tory governments have indeed left behind and not done any levelling up whatsoever. “People feel really fed up in a lot of those towns, but it's also about preserving and enhancing and protecting the game of football for fans across the country.” Both the Conservatives and Labour believe that the test carried out to decide whether someone is fit to own a football club should be strengthened. Former Scunthorpe United owner David Hilton, whose own conviction was spent when he bought the club, agrees.\n",

            "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has attacked the Welsh government over speed limits and waiting times, on the first full day of general election campaigning. Speaking at a brewery in Barry, he accused Labour of pursuing a \"war on motorists\" and said Welsh patients were being let down by the state of the Welsh NHS. He was mocked by a senior Labour MP, however, after he asked whether people were looking forward to a football tournament that Wales had not qualified for. First Minister Vaughan Gething said the attack was \"what you'd expect from a Tory prime minister who knows he's in desperate trouble\". Earlier, a Labour MP appeared to distance herself from the Welsh Labour leader over donations to his leadership campaign. Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth urged voters to back his party to ensure Wales is \"never ignored at Westminster\".\n",

            "The Welsh government runs health, education, councils, transport policy and agriculture, among other matters. It is made up of Labour Members of the Senedd (MSs) who are not up for election this year. Mr Sunak, who was joined at the brewery by Welsh Secretary David TC Davies and local Vale of Glamorgan MP Alun Cairns, was shown how the business worked on the second stop of his tour of the UK's four nations. The constituency was Labour during the Blair years and is a target seat for the party in the July poll. Speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Sunak accused the Welsh government of pursuing a \"war on motorists with top-down blanket 20mph speed limits\". Mr Sunak said small businesses owners were facing \"thousands of pounds of higher tax bills\" as a result of changes to business rates. \"The Welsh NHS, run by the Labour government, is the worst performing in Great Britain - waiting times the longest, emergency times the worst. That's the reality of Labour in Wales.\" The Welsh government objects to the term blanket - saying it is an incorrect way to describe a default speed limit limit which applies in most residential areas which were previously 30mph. Mr Sunak said he had a “strong record of investing in Wales”, saying his decision to scrap the second leg of the HS2 high speed rail line, between Birmingham and Manchester, was “going to mean a billion pounds” would be spent electrifying the north Wales main line. Earlier in the visit Mr Sunak was met with a moment of silence when he asked if the European football championships would be a source of revenue. \"So, you're looking forward to all the football?,\" he asked. Wales did not qualify for the tournament. One individual answered: \"We're not so invested in it,\" to which another responded: \"That's because you guys aren't in it\". The prime minister added: \"It'll be a good summer of sport.\" Labour's shadow Welsh Secretary, Jo Stevens, said on social media platform X it was \"another own goal for Rishi\". Later, one of the business owners pictured sat next to Mr Sunak suggested he would not be supporting his party. Lee Skeet, owner of Jackson's oyster bar in Cardiff, said on X he was \"just asked to be there to talk about hospitality\".\n",

Vaughan Gething has now agreed to give the remaining £31,000 to charity, rather than the Labour Party as would normally happen. During his leadership campaign Mr Gething accepted £200,000 from a company owned by a man that was previously convicted of environmental offences – he raised more than £250,000.\n",

The trip to Barry on day one of the campaign was no surprise - it is in the Vale of Glamorgan, one of the Conservative seats most at risk. Also of no surprise was the attack line - what he sees as the Welsh Labour government’s track record here. But that is not without risk. How much will voters take into account things like 20mph and the NHS - both Welsh government responsibilities - when they’re voting in a UK general election? And it also assumes some voters are willing to overlook what they might see as big issues with the Conservative record at UK level over the past 14 years.\n",

He added: \"There is no change without Scotland, there is no Labour without Scotland, Scotland is central to the mission of the next Labour government\". Both Sir Keir and the Conservative leader Rishi Sunak are hoping that this election marks the end of an era in which the Scottish National Party has dominated Scottish politics. Campaigning in the port of Nigg on the Cromarty Firth in the Highlands on Thursday, the prime minister criticised the SNP for imposing higher taxes on workers earning more than £28,500 in Scotland than elsewhere in the UK.

            "The fact that both of the main UK parties are already spending time talking about the SNP reflects both the strength of Scottish nationalism in recent years and the party's apparent weakness now. The SNP has been the dominant force in Scottish politics since Alex Salmond's victory in the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary election and, since 2015, Scotland's largest party at Westminster when, led by Nicola Sturgeon, it won an incredible 56 of the nation's 59 seats. At the most recent general election, in 2019, the SNP took 48 seats, the Conservatives six, the Lib Dems four, and Labour — for decades the powerhouse of Scottish politics — just one. Since then though Scottish nationalists have endured tough times. Nicola Sturgeon resigned last year after progress towards a second independence referendum stalled. Then, Humza Yousaf came and went as her successor, quitting just weeks ago after ditching a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens amid disputes about economic and social policy. John Swinney is now in charge of the SNP for the second time in his long career.\n",

They range from record NHS waiting lists, to a stubborn gap in attainment between the richest and poorest school pupils, to the highest level of drugs deaths in Europe. Then there is the police investigation into the SNP's finances which has led to its former chief executive, Peter Murrell, who is married to Ms Sturgeon, facing charges in connection with embezzlement of funds. Mr Swinney is also facing difficult questions about his position on a former minister who tried to claim an £11,000 data roaming bill on expenses. Overall, the SNP is arguably in its weakest position since Scotland voted against independence by 55 per cent to 45 per cent in a 2014 referendum.\n",

Sir John says if this were to be replicated on polling day in a general election it could translate into 30 Scottish seats for Labour and 16 for the SNP. So what issues are people in Scotland considering as they make up their minds? Aside from the economy, Scottish voters tell pollsters they care most about the health service, housing and education, all three of which are the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, not the UK Parliament in London. That does not mean they are irrelevant in this election though. The Scottish government decides how to spend its budget but the overall amount it has available to spend is largely determined by Westminster.\n",

In fact, polls suggest Mr Sunak's Conservatives may be facing an even steeper mountain in this campaign. The Tories have been around 20 points adrift of Labour in the polls for much of the past year. With the SNP, says Sir Keir, voters can send a message to Westminster but with Labour \"Scotland can send a government.\" Mr Swinney retorts that there is now little difference between the two main UK parties. \"Keir Starmer now supports Brexit, whatever the cost to Scotland,\" he said, noting that the UK had left the European Union despite the opposition of a majority of voters in Scotland.\n",

At the same time Mr Swinney keeps trying to turn the attention back to independence, presenting it as an escape route from what the SNP call broken Brexit Britain — a nation of entrenched low growth, low productivity and high inequality. Sir John Curtice says the reason for Mr Swinney adopting this tactic is clear: \"While support for the SNP has fallen sharply over the last year, support for independence has not. The SNP, he says, has lost \"a significant proportion\" of independence supporters to Labour, the Scottish Greens and Mr Salmond's Alba Party. Persuading those voters to return to the SNP represents \"the SNP's best hope of restoring its fortunes between now and 4 July,\" adds Sir John. Although there is no clear mechanism for Scotland to actually achieve independence at present, because both the Conservatives and Labour are intent on blocking a second referendum, some unionists nonetheless argue that the issue must be addressed.\n",

There has been a widespread redrawing of the map for this poll, with the first boundary changes in Scotland since 2005. The overall UK boundary changes modestly favour the Conservatives whose seat total using estimated 2019 results based on the new boundaries would increase by seven to 372. In this \"notional\" scenario, which will form the baseline for TV, radio and online calculations of who is up and down on election night, Scotland has a net loss of two seats, down from 59 to 57.\n",

            "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has attacked the Welsh government over speed limits and waiting times, on the first full day of general election campaigning. Speaking at a brewery in Barry, he accused Labour of pursuing a \"war on motorists\" and said Welsh patients were being let down by the state of the Welsh NHS. He was mocked by a senior Labour MP, however, after he asked whether people were looking forward to a football tournament that Wales had not qualified for. First Minister Vaughan Gething said the attack was \"what you'd expect from a Tory prime minister who knows he's in desperate trouble\". Earlier, a Labour MP appeared to distance herself from the Welsh Labour leader over donations to his leadership campaign. Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth urged voters to back his party to ensure Wales is \"never ignored at Westminster\".\n",

            "The Welsh government runs health, education, councils, transport policy and agriculture, among other matters. It is made up of Labour Members of the Senedd (MSs) who are not up for election this year. Mr Sunak, who was joined at the brewery by Welsh Secretary David TC Davies and local Vale of Glamorgan MP Alun Cairns, was shown how the business worked on the second stop of his tour of the UK's four nations. The constituency was Labour during the Blair years and is a target seat for the party in the July poll. Speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Sunak accused the Welsh government of pursuing a \"war on motorists with top-down blanket 20mph speed limits\". Mr Sunak said small businesses owners were facing \"thousands of pounds of higher tax bills\" as a result of changes to business rates. \"The Welsh NHS, run by the Labour government, is the worst performing in Great Britain - waiting times the longest, emergency times the worst. That's the reality of Labour in Wales.\" The Welsh government objects to the term blanket - saying it is an incorrect way to describe a default speed limit limit which applies in most residential areas which were previously 30mph. Mr Sunak said he had a “strong record of investing in Wales”, saying his decision to scrap the second leg of the HS2 high speed rail line, between Birmingham and Manchester, was “going to mean a billion pounds” would be spent electrifying the north Wales main line. Earlier in the visit Mr Sunak was met with a moment of silence when he asked if the European football championships would be a source of revenue. \"So, you're looking forward to all the football?,\" he asked. Wales did not qualify for the tournament. One individual answered: \"We're not so invested in it,\" to which another responded: \"That's because you guys aren't in it\". The prime minister added: \"It'll be a good summer of sport.\" Labour's shadow Welsh Secretary, Jo Stevens, said on social media platform X it was \"another own goal for Rishi\". Later, one of the business owners pictured sat next to Mr Sunak suggested he would not be supporting his party. Lee Skeet, owner of Jackson's oyster bar in Cardiff, said on X he was \"just asked to be there to talk about hospitality\".\n",

            "First Minister Vaughan Gething said on Thursday: “We know the difference that a Labour government makes, and we know that two Labour governments at either end of the M4 can transform Wales and transform Britain.” In an interview Mr Gething said the criticism of the Welsh government was “what you’d expect from a Tory prime minister who knows he’s in desperate trouble. “I want a change election for people to look at the position you find yourself in with your family. “Are you better off now than four and a half years ago or 14 years ago? “Are you optimistic about the future of the country with four more years of Rishi Sunak, after Liz Truss, after Boris Johnson, after David Cameron?” Asked about a poll by Redfield and Wilton Strategies which suggested his approval rating had fallen in recent weeks, Mr Gething said: “I think you look at what’s happened in the last few weeks, it’s no surprise people take a different view.” He said the donation row will not overshadow Labour’s campaign, and that voters were not asking about it.\n",

Vaughan Gething has now agreed to give the remaining £31,000 to charity, rather than the Labour Party as would normally happen. During his leadership campaign Mr Gething accepted £200,000 from a company owned by a man that was previously convicted of environmental offences – he raised more than £250,000.\n",

            "By Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor After it rained on his parade yesterday Rishi Sunak at least appeared to avoid any puns about his organisational skills after a visit to a brewery - brief faux pas about the football aside. The trip to Barry on day one of the campaign was no surprise - it is in the Vale of Glamorgan, one of the Conservative seats most at risk. Also of no surprise was the attack line - what he sees as the Welsh Labour government’s track record here. But that is not without risk. How much will voters take into account things like 20mph and the NHS - both Welsh government responsibilities - when they’re voting in a UK general election? And it also assumes some voters are willing to overlook what they might see as big issues with the Conservative record at UK level over the past 14 years.\n",

            "“Move fast and break things” is a motto that continues to haunt the tech sector, some 20 years after it was coined by a young Mark Zuckerberg. Those five words came to symbolise Silicon Valley at its worst - a combination of ruthless ambition and a rather breathtaking arrogance - profit-driven innovation without fear of consequence. I was reminded of that phrase this week when the actor Scarlett Johansson clashed with OpenAI. Ms Johansson claimed both she and her agent had declined for her to be the voice of its new product for ChatGPT - and then when it was unveiled it sounded just like her anyway. OpenAI denies that it was an intentional imitation. It’s a classic illustration of exactly what the creative industries are so worried about - being mimicked and eventually replaced by artificial intelligence. Listen to Zoe read this article There are echoes in all this of the macho Silicon Valley giants of old. Seeking forgiveness rather than permission as an unofficial business plan. The tech firms of 2024 are extremely keen to distance themselves from that reputation. And OpenAI wasn’t shaped from that mould. It was originally a non-profit organisation committed to investing any extra profits back into the business. In 2019, when it formed a profit-making arm, the company said it would be led by the non-profit side, and there would be a cap on the returns for investors. Not everybody was happy about the shift - it was said to have been a key reason behind co-founder Elon Musk's decision to walk away. And when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was suddenly fired by the board late last year, one of the theories was that he wanted to move further away from the original mission. We never found out for sure. But even if OpenAI has become more profit-driven, it still has to face up to its responsibilities.\n",

            "Stuff of nightmares\n",
            "\n",
            "In the world of policy-making, almost everyone is agreed on the need for clear boundaries to keep companies like OpenAI in line before disaster strikes. So far, the AI giants have largely played ball on paper. At the world’s first AI Safety Summit six months ago, a group of tech bosses signed a voluntary pledge to create responsible, safe products that would maximise the benefits of AI technology and minimise its risks. Those risks they spoke of were the stuff of nightmares - this was Terminator, Doomsday, AI-goes-rogue-and-destroys-humanity territory. Last week, a draft UK government report from a group of 30 independent experts concluded that there was “no evidence yet” that AI could generate a biological weapon or carry out a sophisticated cyber attack. The plausibility of humans losing control of AI was “highly contentious”, it said. And when the summit reconvened earlier this week, the word “safety” had been removed entirely from the conference title. Some people in the field have been saying for quite a while that the more immediate threat from AI tools was that they will replace jobs or cannot recognise skin colours. These are the real problems, says AI ethics expert Dr Rumman Chowdhury. And there are further complications. That report claimed there was currently no reliable way of understanding exactly why AI tools generate the output that they do - even their developers aren’t sure. And the established safety testing practice known as red teaming, in which evaluators deliberately try to get an AI tool to misbehave, has no best-practice guidelines. And at that follow-up summit this week, hosted jointly by the UK and South Korea in Seoul, tech firms committed to shelving a product if it didn’t meet certain safety thresholds - but these will not be set until the next gathering in 2025. While the experts debate the nature of the threats posed by AI, the tech companies keep shipping products. The past few days alone have seen the launch of ChatGPT-4O from OpenAI, Project Astra from Google, and CoPilot+ from Microsoft. The AI Safety Institute declined to say whether it had the opportunity to test these tools before their release. OpenAI says it has a 10-point safety process, but one of its senior safety-focused engineers resigned earlier this week, saying his department had been “sailing against the wind” internally. “Over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products,” Jan Leike posted on X.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are, of course, other teams at OpenAI who continue to focus on safety and security. But there’s no official, independent oversight of what any of these companies are actually doing. “Volunteer agreements essentially are just a means of firms marking their own homework,” says Andrew Strait, associate director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent research organisation. “It's essentially no replacement for legally binding and enforceable rules which are required to incentivise responsible development of these technologies.\" “We have no guarantee that these companies are sticking to their pledges,” says Professor Dame Wendy Hall, one of the UK’s leading computer scientists. “How do we hold them to account on what they’re saying, like we do with drugs companies or in other sectors where there is high risk?” Tougher rules are coming. The EU passed its AI Act, the first law of its kind, and has tough penalties for non-compliance, but some argue it will impact users - who will have to risk-assess AI tools themselves - rather than those that develop the AI . But this doesn’t necessarily mean that AI companies are off the hook. “We need to move towards legal regulation over time but we can’t rush it,” says Prof Hall. “Setting up global governance principles that everyone signs up to is really hard.” “We also need to make sure it’s genuinely worldwide and not just the Western world and China that we are protecting.” The overriding issue, as ever, is that regulation and policy move a lot more slowly than innovation. Prof Hall believes the “stars are aligning” at government levels. The question is whether the tech giants can be persuaded to wait for them.\n",

            "Benjamin Netanyahu responded with fury to the news that he might face an arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It was \"a moral outrage of historic proportions\", he said. Israel was \"waging a just war against Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organisation that perpetrated the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\" In a bitter personal attack, Mr Netanyahu said Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was one of the \"great antisemites in modern times.\" Mr Khan, he said, was like judges in Nazi Germany who denied Jews basic rights and enabled the Holocaust. His decision to seek arrest warrants against Israel’s prime minister and defence minister was \"callously pouring gasoline on the fires of antisemitism that are raging around the world.’ Mr Netanyahu spoke English on the video that was released by his office. He does that when he wants his message to reach the foreign audience that matters most to him, in the US.\n",

            "\n",
            "Reacting to the news, Israeli Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant on Tuesday described the arrest warrants against him and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a \"disgraceful\" attempt to interfere in the war. \"The attempt of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, to reverse the creation will not succeed - the parallel of the prosecutor between the terrorist organization Hamas and the State of Israel is despicable and disgusting.\" he said in a post on X. Before adding: \"The State of Israel is not a party to the Court and does not recognize its authority.\" The outrage expressed by the prime minister, and echoed by Israel’s political leadership, was generated by pages of carefully chosen legal language in a statement issued by Mr Khan, the ICC chief prosecutor who is a British King’s Counsel. Word by word, line by line, they add up to a devastating series of allegations against the three most prominent leaders of Hamas as well as Israel’s prime minister and defence minister. A determination to apply international law and the laws of armed conflict to all parties, no matter who they are, lies at the heart of Mr Khan’s statement in which he lays out his justification for requesting arrest warrants. \"No foot soldier, no commander, no civilian leader - no one - can act with impunity.\" The law, he says, cannot be applied selectively. If that happens, \"we will be creating conditions for its collapse\". It is the decision to hold both sides’ conduct up to the template of international law that is causing so much anger, and not just in Israel.\n",
            "\n",
            "US President Joe Biden said it was \"outrageous\" to apply for arrest warrants. There was \"no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas\". Hamas demanded the withdrawal of the allegations against its leaders, claiming that the ICC’s prosecutor was \"equating the victim with the executioner\". It said the request to issue arrest warrants for the Israeli leadership came seven months too late, after \"the Israeli occupation committed thousands of crimes\". Mr Khan does not make direct comparisons between the two sides, except to lay out his claim that they have both committed a series of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He also emphasises that this latest war comes in the context of \"an international armed conflict between Israel and Palestine, and a non-international armed conflict between Israel and Hamas\". The court treats Palestine as a state as it has observer status at the United Nations, which meant it was able to sign up to the Rome Statute which created the ICC. Mr Netanyahu has declared that Palestinians will never have independence on his watch.\n",

            "Instead of seeing disgraceful and false parallels between, as Israel’s President Isaac Herzog put it, \"these atrocious terrorists and a democratically elected government of Israel\", human rights groups have applauded the way that the ICC prosecutor is seeking to apply the law to both sides. B'Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organisation, said the warrants marked \"Israel’s rapid decline into a moral abyss\". \"The international community is signalling to Israel that it can no longer maintain its policy of violence, killing and destruction without accountability,\" it added. Human rights campaigners have complained for many years that powerful Western countries, led by the US, turn a blind eye to Israeli violations of international law, even as they condemn and sanction other states who are not in their camp. The actions being taken by Mr Khan and his team are, they believe, long overdue. Mr Khan says that the three main leaders of Hamas committed war crimes that include extermination, murder, hostage-taking, rape and torture. The men named are Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, Mohammed Deif, the commander of the Qassam Brigades, its military wing, and Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas political bureau. As part of their investigation, Karim Khan and his team interviewed victims and survivors of the 7 October attacks. He said Hamas had assaulted fundamental human values: \"the love within a family, the deepest bonds between a parent and a child were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness\". Israel, Mr Khan said, does have the right to defend itself. But \"unconscionable crimes\" did not \"absolve Israel of its obligation to comply with international humanitarian law\". The failure to do that, he said, justified issuing warrants for the arrest of Mr Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for crimes including starvation of civilians as a weapon of war, murder, extermination, and intentional attacks on civilians.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the start of Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks of 7 October, President Biden has issued a series of rebukes to Israel, expressing concern that it was killing too many Palestinian civilians and destroying too much civilian infrastructure in Gaza. But in a careful balancing act with a close ally which he has always supported, Mr Biden and his administration have not spelt out in public about what they mean. Mr Khan makes his interpretation crystal clear. Israel, he says, has chosen criminal means to achieve its war aims in Gaza - \"namely, intentionally causing death, starvation, great suffering, and serious injury\" to civilians. A panel of judges at the ICC now will consider whether to issue the arrest warrants. States signed up to the ICC’s Rome Statute would then be obliged to detain the men if they had the chance. The 124 signatories do not include Russia, China and the US. Israel has not signed either. But the ICC has ruled that it does have legal authority to prosecute criminal acts in the war because the Palestinians are signatories. If the arrest warrants are issued, it would mean that Mr Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, would not be able to visit close Western allies without risking arrest. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the ICC’s actions were \"not helpful to reaching a pause in the fighting, getting hostages out or humanitarian aid in\". But if the warrants are issued, Britain would have to make the arrests, unless it could argue successfully that Mr Netanyahu had diplomatic immunity.\n",

            "Ebrahim Raisi stood close to the pinnacle of power in the Islamic Republic and was widely tipped to rise to its very top. A dramatic turn dealt him a different hand. His death in a helicopter crash on Sunday has upended the growing speculation over who will eventually replace the 85-year-old Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose own health has long been the focus of intense interest. The tragic fate of Iran’s hardline president is not expected to disrupt the direction of Iranian policy or jolt the Islamic Republic in any consequential way. But it will test a system where conservative hardliners now dominate all branches of power, both elected and unelected. “The system will make a massive show of his death and stick to constitutional procedures to show functionality, while it seeks a new recruit who can maintain conservative unity and loyalty to Khamenei,” observes Dr Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the Chatham House think tank. Raisi's opponents will hail the exit of a former prosecutor accused of a decisive role in the mass execution of political prisoners in the 1980s which he denied; they will hope the end of his rule hastens the end of this regime. For Iran’s ruling conservatives, the state funeral will be an occasion freighted with emotion; it will also be an opportunity to start sending their signals of continuity. They know the world is watching. “For 40 some years, in Western narratives, Iran was supposed to collapse and fall apart,\" Professor Mohammed Marandi of Tehran University told the BBC. \"But somehow, miraculously, it's still here and I predict it will still be here in years to come.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Another critical position which must be filled is the seat held by this middle-ranking cleric on the Assembly of Experts, the body empowered to choose the new supreme leader, when that far more consequential transition comes. “Raisi was a potential successor because, like Khamenei himself when he became supreme leader, he was relatively young, very loyal, an ideologue committed to the system who has name recognition,” says Dr Vakil of this opaque process of selection, where a number of names are seen to be in the running including the Supreme Leader’s son Mojtaba Khamenei. Even before Raisi’s death was officially confirmed, the Ayatollah conveyed in a post on X that “the Iranian people should not worry, there will be no disruption in the country’s affairs.” The more immediate political challenge will be staging early presidential elections. Power has been transferred to Vice-President Mohammad Mokhber; new elections must be held within 50 days. This appeal to voters will come just months after March’s parliamentary elections revealed a record low turnout in a country which once prided itself on strong enthusiastic participation in this exercise. Recent elections, including the contest in 2021 which brought Raisi to the presidency, were also marked by the systematic exclusion of moderate and pro-reform rivals by the oversight body. “Early presidential elections could provide Khamenei and the upper echelons of the state with an opportunity to reverse that trajectory to give voters a way back into the political process,” says Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of London-based news website Amwaj.media. “But, unfortunately, so far we have seen no indications of the state being ready and willing to take such a step.”\n",

            "Iranian president seen in helicopter before incident\n",
            "\n",
            "But, even within Raisi’s ranks, there appears to be no obvious successor. “There are different camps within this conservative group, including individuals who are more hardline and others regarded as more pragmatic,” points out Hamidreza Azizi, a visiting fellow at SWP, the Berlin-based think tank. He believes this will intensify the current jockeying for position within the new parliament and at local levels. Whoever assumes Raisi’s mantle inherits a forbidding agenda and limited levers of power. Ultimate decision-making authority in the Islamic Republic lies with the Supreme Leader. Foreign policy, especially in the region, is the preserve of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) who wield growing power. The president didn’t call the shots months ago when Iran confronted unprecedented tensions with its arch-enemy Israel over the devastating Israel Gaza war. It triggered a dangerous tit-for-tat and set alarm bells ringing in many capitals, most of all Tehran, over the potential for an even riskier escalatory spiral. But as he presided over day-to-day business, Iranians struggled to cope with deepening financial hardship linked to crippling international sanctions as well as mismanagement and corruption. Inflation soared to more than 40%; the rial currency plunged in value. On his watch, the Islamic Republic was also shaken by an extraordinary wave of protests sparked by the death in custody in September 2022 of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini who was detained by morality police for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress code. Weeks before the unrest, Raisi had ordered a tightening of Iran’s “hijab and chastity law” which obligated women to behave and dress modestly including wearing a headscarf.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the protests spearheaded by a young generation of women, lashing out against a raft of restrictions imposed on their lives, mainly focused their fury on the real sources of power, the Supreme Leader and the system itself. Human rights groups say hundreds were killed in the crackdown and thousands detained. “Having been elected with the lowest recorded turnout in presidential elections in Iranian history, Raisi did not have the popular mandate of his predecessor Rouhani,“ says Shabani in reference to the reformist leader Hassan Rouhani whose initial popularity was partly fuelled by the 2015 landmark nuclear deal which fell apart when President Trump unilaterally pulled the US out three years later. Indirect talks between President Biden’s administration and Raisi’s team made little progress. “He avoided much of the ire which was directed at Rouhani by opponents of the Islamic Republic, partly because he was simply seen as less influential and effectual,” explains Shabani.\n",

It’s taken months of quiet negotiations to sit down at Tsai Ing-wen’s dining table in her Taipei residence, not long before she leaves office after eight years and hands over to her successor William Lai. Even so, the president seems keener to ask about me than talk about herself. She is certainly more comfortable showing us her cats and dogs than answering questions in front of a rolling camera. “That’s Xiang Xiang,” she says, pointing to the large, grey tabby eyeing me suspiciously through the open doorway. “Would you like to meet her?” When Tsai Ing-wen swept to power in 2016, she was dismissed as a dull bureaucrat and ridiculed as a “cat lady” - a swipe at her for being middle-aged and unmarried. She embraced the image, appearing on magazine covers holding Xiang Xiang in her arms. Soon, her supporters adopted a new sobriquet: Taiwan’s Iron Cat Lady.\n",

            "Tsai admits to a sneaking admiration for Margaret Thatcher, although she’s quick to add it’s because of her toughness as a female leader, not her social policies. In Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan found an unlikely champion. During her two terms, she carefully yet confidently reset the relationship with Beijing, which has claimed the independently governed island as its own for 75 years. She stood up to an increasingly authoritarian and aggressive China under Xi Jinping; she held on to a vital US alliance under Donald Trump and buttressed it under Joe Biden. At home, she expanded the island’s defence and legalised same-sex marriage, the latter a first for Asia. While Tsai shied away from the spotlight in Taiwan’s boisterous politics, Xiang Xiang became a celebrity. She played a starring role in Tsai's 2020 re-election campaign, along with the president’s other cat, a ginger tom called Ah Tsai. Tsai has her detractors. Beijing is no fan, and neither are the many older Taiwanese, who want better relations with China, where they have family and business interests. Domestically, she has been criticised for not doing enough for the economy – the rising cost of living, unaffordable housing and a lack of jobs cost her party young voters in January's election. And her biggest critics fear that she has made the island of 23 million more, rather than less, unsafe. Put crudely, this is what any Taiwan leader faces: a much bigger, wealthier, and stronger neighbour, who says he owns your house, is willing to let you hand it over without a fight, but is ready to use force if you refuse. What do you do?\n",

            "Tsai’s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, chose conciliation and a Beijing-friendly trade deal. But he miscalculated how young Taiwanese would react to what they saw as appeasement. In 2014, thousands took to the streets in what became known as the Sunflower Movement. When President Ma refused to back down, they occupied parliament. Two years later Tsai Ing-wen was elected on a very different calculus: that the only language Beijing understands is strength. Now, as she prepares to step down, she says she has been vindicated: “China has become so aggressive and assertive.”\n",

He tells her he is 185cm and she asks, with genuine concern, “Are the beds here big enough for you?” They are, he reassures her. This was on a recent morning in April at a new special forces training centre on the outskirts of Taipei, which Tsai had just opened. The relaxed and chatty president disappears when she enters the cavernous dining hall, where hundreds of crew-cut recruits stand to attention and shouted “Zong Tong Hao!”, or “Hello, President!” She almost looks out of place in these settings. Her speech is worthy and matter of fact, with no soaring rhetoric. And yet such visits are quite frequent, to make sure the military reforms she has pushed through are paying off. One of the most difficult was a return to a year of military service for all men over the age of 18. While she admits it is not popular, she says the public accepts it is necessary: “But we have to make sure that their time spent in the military is worthwhile.”\n",

            "For a former law professor and trade negotiator, Tsai has spent a surprisingly large amount of time as president donning camouflage fatigues. In one famous image she’s seen shouldering a rocket launcher. The reason: she believes Taiwan cannot hope to fend off Beijing without a modern, well-trained military in which young Taiwanese are proud to serve. While China's threat of invasion is not new, it is only recently that President Xi Jinping has gained the military capability to mount what would still be a huge and risky operation. His threats have also become more urgent and ominous. He has said twice that a resolution over Taiwan cannot be passed down from one generation to another, which some have interpreted to mean that he wants it done in his lifetime. On the other side of the strait, Tsai has set about rebuilding Taiwan’s outdated, demoralised and ill-equipped ground forces. It has been an uphill struggle, but results have begun to show. Yearly defence spending has risen significantly to about $20bn (£16bn). “Our military capability is much strengthened compared to eight years ago. The investment we have put in to military capacity is unprecedented,” Tsai says.\n",

            "I have spoken to many in Taiwan’s opposition who genuinely believe Tsai’s strategy of building up the military is naive, if not dangerous. They point to China’s powerful navy, the world’s largest, and more than two million active troops. Taiwan’s forces are not even a tenth of that. To Tsai and her supporters that is missing the point. Taiwan is not trying to defeat a Chinese invasion, they say, but dramatically increasing its price to deter China. “The cost of taking over Taiwan is going to be enormous,” Tsai says. “What we need to do is increase the cost.” Tsai was no stranger to Beijing, or the Chinese Communist Party, when she became president. Her unorthodox rise to power began in the mid-1990s, when she cut her teeth as a trade negotiator. She then caught the eye of Chen Shui-bian, the first president from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). He appointed her to run Taiwan’s top body for dealing with China. There she rewrote the book on how Taiwan should handle Beijing. She has long known where the red lines are - and she believes that to resist China, Taiwan needs allies: “So strengthening our military capacity is one and working with our friends in the region to form a collective deterrence is another.” Many in Tsai’s party, the DPP, now talk of a new alliance that stretches from Japan and South Korea to the north, through the Philippines to Australia in the south – with the US as quarterback, holding the team together. But this is theoretical at best. There is no Asian Nato and Taiwan enjoys no formal military alliances. Despite mutual antipathy towards Beijing, Tokyo and Manila are both deeply reluctant to vow support for Taiwan. Even that most important ally, Washington, has stopped short of guaranteeing it would put boots on the ground.\n",

            "But Tsai is optimistic. “A lot of other countries in the region are alert and some of them may have a conflict with China,” she says, referring to rival claims by Beijing, Tokyo and Manila over disputed waters and islands. “So, China is not an issue for Taiwan only. It is an issue for the whole region.”\n",

            "Painting China as a big, bad bully is not hard for a Taiwan president. The trickier job is to find allies who would risk irking the world’s second largest economy. And that’s why Taiwan leads such an increasingly lonely diplomatic existence. In the last decade China has put the squeeze on many of the island’s allies who still recognise it – only 12 remain now, most of them tiny Pacific Island and Caribbean micro-states. Tsai believes the way out of this diplomatic isolation is to build alliances with what she calls “like-minded democracies”. To that end she hosts dozens of parliamentary delegations from all over the world, a loophole for meeting foreign dignitaries from countries that don’t see Taiwan as one. Last month I attended Holocaust Memorial Day. There was music and poetry, and an impassioned speech to never forget by the representative from Germany. There are also more unusual events. Earlier this week, while Xi Jinping was getting ready to welcome Vladimir Putin in Beijing, Tsai Ing-wen hosted a drag performance by Taiwanese-American Nymphia Wind. “This is probably the first presidential office in the world to host a drag show,” Nymphia reportedly told Tsai. Both are examples of brand Taiwan – a democracy that the world should care about losing. “People say we are more important than Ukraine - strategically our position is more important and our place in the supply chain - and that they should shift support to Taiwan. We say no. The democratic countries need to support Ukraine,” Tsai says. Rather than Taiwan’s wildly successful chip industry, which could be replicated, instead Tsai wields the one thing she has and the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t: the soft power of democracy. In the run up to January’s election, the rainbow flag was hard to miss at every DPP rally. “In Taiwan we are free to live how we choose. We could not do this in China,” one couple told me. It’s a remarkable change from when I was a student here more than 30 years ago. Taiwan was still emerging from four decades of military rule. I remember a gay friend desperately looking for a way to get to America. Back then, if you were found to be homosexual during your military service you could get thrown in jail or a psychiatric ward. That changed but Tsai Ing-wen’s government went further than any in Asia when it pushed through legislation legalising same-sex marriage in 2019. A little over half the population still opposed it. Some, including church and family groups, ran a vociferous campaign against it. It was a big political risk, and one that could have cost her re-election. Tsai calls it a “very difficult journey” but one she saw as necessary: “It's a test to society to see to what extent we can move forward with our values. I am actually rather proud that we managed to overcome our differences.” Taiwan is still conservative and patriarchal. I ask Tsai if she’s worried it might return to being a “boys club” once she, the island’s first female president, steps down. “I have a lot of opinions about that boys club!” she says but does not elaborate. The island’s strength, in her opinion, is its mixed heritage – it’s a society of immigrants. The Chinese came in many waves, sometimes centuries apart, and they joined hundreds of thousands of indigenous peoples. “In… [such a] society, there are a lot of challenges,” Tsai says. “People are less bound by the traditions. The main goal is to survive [as a society]. This is why we have been able to move from an authoritarian age to democracy.” And that is why she hopes Taiwan’s most important alliance – with the world’s most powerful country and democracy - will last no matter who makes it to the White House after November.\n",

He’s criticised the island for “stealing America’s semiconductor industry”, but, as Tsai points out, he has also approved more arms shipments to Taipei than any of his predecessors. But she doesn’t want to discuss him, or the possibility of his return to the Oval Office.\n",

            "What she does want to emphasise is the perception of a growing China threat. “The rest of the world is telling China that you can't use military means [against Taiwan]. No unilateral action is allowed and no non-peaceful means is allowed and… I think China got the message,” she says. That might be wishful thinking. There has been no noticeable decrease in military pressure. Rather, China regularly sends dozens of military aircraft and ships across the median line that divides the waters and airspace of the Taiwan strait. In 2022, Beijing declared that it no longer recognises what was effectively the border. The trigger was one of Tsai’s diplomatic coups. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s historic visit in 2022 was celebrated in a Taiwan starved of international recognition. But China was furious, firing ballistic missiles over the island, and into the Pacific Ocean, for the first time ever. It was a warning. Even some inside Tsai’s own administration worried quietly that Pelosi’s visit had been a mistake. “We’ve been isolated for such a long time,” she says. “You just can't say no to a visit like that of Speaker Pelosi. Of course it comes with risks.” You can feel the tension in her voice. Her opponents say the Pelosi visit was reckless and left Taiwan more exposed. Even President Biden is thought to have opposed the trip. But Tsai says this is the line Taiwan must walk. “I had to turn a party of revolutionaries into a party of power,” Tsai Ing-wen says of her time at the DPP’s helm. When she took over, she was an economics graduate leading a party of older, male radicals who had spent their early lives fighting for Taiwan independence – or behind bars for it. There is no need for Taiwan to hold a referendum or declare independence, she says, because it is already an independent, sovereign nation. “We are on our own. We make our own decisions; we have a political system to govern this place. We have a constitution, we have laws, we have a military. We think that we are a country, and we have all the elements of a state.” What they are waiting for, she says, is for the world to recognise it.\n",

            "In Myanmar’s eastern Karenni State, the sleepy jungle town of Demoso has come alive with revolutionary fervour. In the burnt-red soil along the sides of the town’s main road, a transformation is under way. Newly made bamboo-and-wood-built shops and cafes have sprung up, and the talk in all of them is of one thing: resistance. For decades, ethnic groups here have fought the military leadership that has ruled the South East Asian nation. A transition to democracy was cut short by a military coup three years ago, and since then, the town has become a magnet for young fighters and activists. Robbed of their first taste of democratic freedom, they took to the streets and joined in acts of civil disobedience. They were met with violence and arrests. Many left Yangon and other major cities for this remote jungle outpost to join the insurgency that is sweeping across the countryside. In one new bar - Yangon Vibes - a long-haired rapper Novem Thu, 33, is on his second cocktail. Their specialty here is an electric blue margherita, but Novem Thu favours something darker. Around him the air buzzes with talk of the insurgents’ successes.\n",

            "“There is only Plan A, destroying the military. There is no Plan B,” Novem tells me. He isn’t a soldier but spends most of his time with the resistance on the front line. “My job is to motivate them,” he says. His music is blood-curdling, and he brandishes a weapon in his videos - a toy gun from his brother, he tells me. After sunset, Yangon Vibes pulls down blackout blinds over the bar’s bright lights, to avoid the military’s drones and war planes. This area has been bombed regularly. A revolutionary radio station, Federal FM, broadcasts from outside the town - using a mobile transmitter to avoid being targeted by airstrikes. Most of Karenni is without electricity and the mobile network barely works - the military junta has cut off both. But the bar offers free internet, and so do cafes all along the main road, courtesy of the satellite service Starlink. This is a generation that likes to stay connected and one that is mounting a nimble and effective war of resistance all from the cover of the jungle. Their insurgency is the greatest threat to military rule in Myanmar in years. This is an under-reported conflict. The military restricts press freedom and has jailed hundreds of journalists. There is no way to hear the resistance side of this story through government-approved visits. We travelled into Myanmar and spent a month living alongside resistance groups fighting across Karenni State. On a dirt road outside Demoso we visit a hideout - a sanctuary for those fleeing the cities. Waiting in the small bamboo encampment is a group of eight young people, aged between 15 and 23, who have recently arrived. Many have travelled from far-away Yangon, along country roads at night. An “underground railroad” has been established from Myanmar’s main cities, for those rebelling against the military’s new conscription law. It spirits them along clandestine routes, through safe houses and handlers, to Karenni and other resistance-held areas. Some came by car, others by motorbike or boat, spending the night outdoors to try to avoid military checkpoints. At one, all the young people were told to get out of the car by the soldiers who then checked their papers and went through their phones. The young people had anticipated this and cleared their phones of anything incriminating. They were allowed to pass.\n",

            "They almost look out of place in this wilderness. They are dressed in fashionable gear as they sit checking their phones, again thanks to Starlink, while cicadas buzz in the forest around them. One says he disguised himself as a villager, hiding his city clothes to avoid detection at a checkpoint. The journey was hard, says Thura, “I had to spend that night sleeping with fear. It was a place I had never been or known. After that, they picked me up in the morning and brought me here safely.” Names have been changed to protect the identity of those who spoke to us. Many of them still fear for their families back in the cities. There is a burning sense of betrayal among them. They grew up during Myanmar’s transition to democracy, which began in 2015 after more than half a century of military rule. But the promise of freedom was snatched away with the military coup in 2021, which toppled the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Most of the group have completed the month-long basic military training offered by the armed opposition group, the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF), which operates here. The KNDF was established after the coup, and its leadership of a disparate grouping of Karenni resistance and ethnic groups, has pushed the troops of the military junta out of 90% of the state, it claims. I ask one fighter, Thiha, why he has chosen to take up arms. He replies that he only has two choices - to fight for the military or to join the revolutionary forces. “[If] I fight for [the army], I will be tormenting my own people and will be killing them,” he says. There are those, however, who have chosen not to fight but to dedicate themselves to the revolution in other ways. On a scorching hot day, we travel along a hillside track under the cover of the thick jungle canopy to reach a secret hospital which is treating civilians and fighters alike. It looks like no medical facility I have seen. On the outside there is a random collection of huts and shelters, but inside are scanners, X-ray machines and 60 hospital beds. Subterfuge is essential, the previous hospital was bombed by the military.\n",

            "I am met by 28-year-old Dr Yori, who fled here a year ago. What looks like a small, grey building, with newly planted vegetation camouflaging its roof turns out to be the entrance to an underground operating theatre. It is hidden away to stop the planes of the military junta bombing it, he tells me. Men and women - many who have lost limbs - are lying on beds on a dirt floor in the recovery ward. The UN says Myanmar is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world and that injuries have soared since the coup. The war has killed tens of thousands, many of them children. The military doesn’t distinguish between civilians and resistance fighters in opposition areas, it has labelled them terrorists and targeted both. In one nearby village, a family of six were killed in an airstrike - including a two-year-old and six-year-old child - in the days before I visited the hospital. From another ward, the sound of a baby crying pierces through the drill of the cicadas from the jungle. They also deliver babies here. Before the war, and until the young revolutionaries arrived, medical facilities were in short supply in Karenni state. None of the medical staff here are local, they have come from all over the country. Yori’s fiance Tracy is one of them. She is in the operating theatre, finishing surgery on a man wounded in an artillery strike. The couple didn’t get a chance to finish medical school. They were final-year students in Yangon, and vocal critics of the coup. Tracy was a student leader. The military issued arrest warrants for both her and Yori. Initially, they considered taking up arms but realised their medical skills would be of more use in Karenni state. Their hospital has been up and running for three months now and has 35 staff, almost all under 30 years of age. As we sit in the makeshift hospital canteen drinking instant coffee, I ask how they cope with the hardships of jungle living and cope mentally with the terrible injuries they treat. “The mentality of the patients, you just saw this this morning, they're very strong men. [That] impacts on us. Even amputated soldiers are fighting, still fighting, why should we quit?” says Yori. Tracy agrees. “We can cry the whole day, that’s OK. But we have to stand up again. If we are not here, who will treat those patients?”\n",

Do they think Myanmar’s war has been forgotten, I ask. “A little bit, yes,” replies Yori. “Because maybe other people from other regions of the world might think that this is just a civil war because we are fighting each other for no probable reason. But there is a reason we are fighting, and the reason is basic human rights.” The couple were meant to get married last year, but an upcoming opposition offensive meant their hospital would have been full of casualties, so they postponed. A second wedding this month was also delayed for the same reason. “Maybe this December,” Yori says with a smile. “I hope so,” laughs Tracy. Karenni’s official state capital, Loikaw, is all but abandoned to the war. Since November, the KNDF and junta forces have been locked in street battles. On a hot day in April, the boulevards and parks of the city are silent, but for the sound of crows and the occasional rifle fire. Whole neighbourhoods have been destroyed by the military’s airstrikes, armed drones, and mortar and artillery fire. The city’s main military base is full of soldiers and is still being resupplied by helicopter. But on the ground at least, the opposition forces have them surrounded. Sam and Cobra are both in their early 20s, they have known each other for 13 years and went to school together in Loikaw. They became national karate champions, and moved to Yangon, but now they find themselves back in this contested capital, in front line positions facing the military. Their path to becoming armed revolutionaries is not uncommon among the young fighters for the KNDF. Before the military coup, Cobra had moved from karate to mixed martial arts, and was making good money in Yangon as a trainer. “After the coup, we were protesting peacefully,” he says. “Then the army starts shooting people and killing the people.” Sam says he was never political, until karate competitions took him overseas. “I was in Japan when I saw my country didn’t have to be the way it was.”\n",

According to some estimates, the military has lost control of between half and two-thirds of the country, as established armed resistance and ethnic groups have joined together to challenge its rule. But in many respects, it is hard to fully comprehend the strength of the resistance in Karenni, so much of it is hidden along dark forest tracks, away from view in deep jungle camps and bases.\n",

            "Six years later, BBC One's Panorama programme secretly filmed a near-naked detainee being dragged screaming through the Brook House Immigration Removal Centre before being taken to an airport. A public inquiry called following the documentary highlighted 10 examples of inappropriate and potentially dangerous use of force by detention officers at Brook House, near Gatwick. As they would never return to the UK, detainees sent to Rwanda may be less likely to comply with their removal. The charity Medical Justice says it has assessed more than 30 people in detention centres, awaiting removal under the Rwanda programme. According to its director, Emma Ginn, they include “victims of torture and trafficking, people who are highly distressed, and lots of people saying they have mental-health conditions and physical conditions\". There was a only “slim chance” of them complying and force not being required, she said. The Home Office says force must be used as a last resort only and, following the Brook House inquiry, new guidelines are being developed.\n",

It's a rehearsal of how Beijing would take the island, as it has vowed to do repeatedly. China has already set a new normal in the Taiwan Strait, steadily ramping up military pressure on the self-governed island. So what is different about these drills - and what do they tell us?\n",

            "\n",
            "It’s hard to tell exactly what is going on, but from what Beijing has made public, the areas covered by these drills are perhaps the biggest we’ve seen yet, and include much of the Taiwan Strait, the Bashi Channel (which separates Taiwan from the Philippines) and large swathes of the Pacific along Taiwan’s east coast. Thursday's drills focused on encircling the island, simulating a full-scale attack, minus the actual landing of troops, Taiwan military expert Chieh Chung says. He thinks the inclusion of all of Taiwan’s off-shore islands demonstrates China’s plan to eliminate facilities that could launch a counter-attack against the PLA. He also thinks this two-day drill will not be the last Taiwan will have to endure this year – hence the name “Joint Sword 2024-A”. Friday's footage shows the People's Liberation Army (PLA) preparing for a mock strike on Taiwan’s main cities and ports. A dramatic video released by the PLA’s Eastern Command, shows fleets of ships approaching Taiwan, accompanied by the words “Push in!” “Encircle!” “Lock!” . The whole of Taiwan is then highlighted in orange – presumably indicating total control. China has also released a video of a PLA colonel explaining the purpose of the drills in politically-charged language: \"As we can see we have set two exercise areas in the sea and air space near the eastern part of the island, mainly to block the escape of 'Taiwan independence' separatists and break through their comfort zone,\" he says. The island's eastern coast hosts crucial military infrastructure and because of its proxomity to Japan's southern islands, is also a reliable resupply route for Taiwan's allies, including the US.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the reality is more prosaic. For one, China has released video of a group of coast guard ships approaching within three nautical miles of a Taiwan-controlled island called Wu-Qiu. This is a tiny rocky outcrop off the coast of Fujian. It’s only occupants are sea bird colonies and a small garrison of Taiwan soldiers. On Thursday, Taiwan’s ministry of defence recorded 49 Chinese aircraft, 19 naval ships and seven coast guard vessels close to Taiwan’s territorial waters. The ships have largely been frigates and corvettes, which are smaller and carry a lighter weapon load. There has been no sign of any Chinese heavy vessels such as amphibious assault ships or aircraft carriers taking part. A real invasion fleet would require much larger ships and much bigger numbers. The last time a major amphibious assault took place close to Taiwan was the US invasion of Okinawa in 1944. That US fleet had nearly 300 naval combatants, including 11 fleet carriers (large aircraft carriers) and hundreds of troop and supply ships.\n",

Beijing says that in doing so Mr Lai revealed his true thinking that Taiwan is not China, and they are two different countries. It is, in their eyes, an admission of his “separatist” ideology. To outsiders this may all sound absurd. But for decades Beijing and Taipei have obfuscated on their definitions of China, and whether Taiwan is part of it. Even former president Tsai was careful to refer to China in euphemistic terms like “the other side of the strait” or “the Beijing authorities”.\n",

            "The \"unprecedented\" excitement among fans outside the London theatre where Spider-Man star Tom Holland is appearing in Romeo and Juliet hasn't quite been matched by the response from the critics inside. The most glowing review - a five-star write-up in the Telegraph - said Holland \"ravishes\" and \"mesmerises\" as Romeo. But at the other end of the scale, the Daily Express's one-star critique called it \"absolute drivel\" and described Holland as \"a charisma free zone\". Time Out said the actor \"certainly doesn’t disgrace himself\", while the Guardian said it was \"a good performance\". Other critics also struggled to get exercised, describing Holland's Romeo as \"fine\", \"perfectly OK\" and \"perfectly plausible\". They were, on the whole, more enthusiastic about Francesca Amewudah-Rivers as Juliet, who was described by Time Out's Andrzej Lukowski as \"great\". \"She has a lightness that contrasts with Holland’s dour angst,\" he wrote. Time Out gave the play four stars, saying director Jamie Lloyd's minimalist production is \"brilliantly unsettling\" and is \"staged like a particularly stylish radio play\".\n",

            "\n",
            "The Times was less enamoured with what it said felt like \"a conscientious but colourless radio drama\". Awarding three stars, critic Clive Davis said Holland was \"quiet, fresh-faced and sensitive\". \"In the opening scenes he really does convince you that he is an adolescent adrift, waiting to abandon himself to a doomed romance,\" he wrote. But in the end, Lloyd's production \"at times felt too formulaic\" and left the audience \"more perplexed than gripped\", he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Guardian's Arifa Akbar also gave three stars and said the two lead stars are \"perfectly cast, wired with an awkwardly cool teen energy, she a mix of innocence and streetwise steel, he jittering with sweaty-palmed earnestness\". \"The chemistry is most definitely there, even if it feels deliberately restrained in Jamie Lloyd’s turbo-stylised production,\" she wrote.

The drama and most characters are hobbled by a slow pace with pauses that break the rhythm and meaning of the script, Benedict said. \"The exception to all this is Juliet... \"But Holland lacks her still stage presence. He’s perfectly plausible as lovestruck Romeo growing increasingly stressed and distressed, but he emotes rather than elicits emotions.\"\n",

            "Elsewhere, the Independent's Tim Bano went further and said Holland’s performance \"falls flat\". \"On comes Holland, a camera following him from backstage. He’s tearful, morose, muttering. He’s a very sad boy in a tight white vest,\" Bano wrote. Footage shot by on-stage cameras, shown on a big screen, has become a hallmark Lloyd's productions, as has what Bano described as \"industrial chic\". \"Or it was chic the first time Lloyd did it, but now it just looks like a fetish for ventilation ducts.\" He added: \"If it had ended at the interval, it would have been brilliant. Instead, it becomes a thing of diminishing returns... \"As for the ending, well, it’s a bit of a letdown.
